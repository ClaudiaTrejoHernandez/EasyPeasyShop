# 🏪 Welcome to the EasyPeasyShop! 🛒

# 📖 About The Project

## Project Description:
This project is an e-commerce application (online store), named EasyPeasyShop. We are given an existing, operational website that uses a Spring Boot API project for the backend server with a MySQL database for data storage. We were given the existing project code to modify, along with starter code that included the database script for the existing data structure. I made code changes in the API starter project, so Postman was used to test the application endpoints and logic. 

# ✍️ Application Requirements: 
Version 1 of this website allows users to browse products in various categories, 
add them to a shopping cart and check out to order the products. All of the 
features of the UI are fully functional. The changes and development will only 
need to be done in the backend Spring Boot Java API project. 
- Existing API Includes:
  - User registration and login
  - The ability to display products by category
  - Search for or filter the products list

## 🐞 Bugs:
The API code I began with was functional, but there were a few bugs in the project. I was tasked with:

  - Finding and fixing those bugs
  - Using manual debugging
  - Writing unit tests to help fix those bugs
